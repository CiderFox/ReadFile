# ReadFile
Assignment 0
ICS 440 Parallel Algorithms

This program is for an assignment to open a selected file and output the exact file under a different name.
The characteristics for the assignment are as follows:
    - Uses JFileChooser to select a file.
    - JFileChooser opens in the currently running directory of the program.
    - The output File name has the same input file name, just concatenated with '_out'.
    - The program closes elegantly if there is no selected file.
    - The program will read the contents of the selected input file, and copy it over to the output file.
